# Numpy-Array-Operations--a2
This assignment is part of the course "Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas" offered by Jovian . 
The objective of this assignment is to develop a solid understanding of Numpy array operations. 
In this assignment I have picked up 5 interesting Numpy array functions by going through the documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.html and various other sources.
The demonstration of each function is illustrated with the help of 3 examples out of which 2 are working examples and the last example signifies where the function/breaks.
Then after it , it provides the probable resolve for that error.
